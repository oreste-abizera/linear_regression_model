# Education Prediction Linear Regression Model

## Mission
To bridge the education gap for rural students by providing access to high-quality learning materials and technologies and fostering their potential through exchange programs in advanced regions to inspire them to achieve great things and uplift their communities.

## Problem and Relevance
This project addresses the education gap in rural communities by building a machine learning model that predicts school life expectancy based on government expenditure patterns. The model helps policymakers understand the relationship between educational investment and outcomes, enabling better resource allocation decisions to bridge the education gap for rural students.
